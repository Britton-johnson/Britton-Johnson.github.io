I completed both mini-assignments #2 and #4. Intially on mini-assignment #2 I created the bare bones of a twine story on Mary Queen of Scots.
In mini-assignment #2 I wrote passages that focused on the important events of her life. Also including passages on her parents and Elizabeth I of England.
With mini-assignment #4 I added color to the text on all of the passages, and on the main passage I changed the background color. 
I also noticed some mistakes made on mini-assignment #2 and fixed those with this submission.
